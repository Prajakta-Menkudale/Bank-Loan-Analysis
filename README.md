📊 Loan Portfolio Performance Dashboard
🧩 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing loan performance data to assess funding trends, repayment behavior, and borrower risk levels. The goal is to derive actionable insights through key performance indicators (KPIs) and interactive visualizations.

📋 Problem Statement

The project aims to analyze the loan dataset to understand the following:

Total Loan Applications — Track the total and Month-to-Date (MTD) loan applications.

Total Funded Amount — Evaluate the total and MTD amounts funded as loans.

Total Amount Received — Assess total and MTD borrower repayments for cash flow insights.

Average Interest Rate — Determine the average rate to gauge lending cost efficiency.

Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio — Measure borrowers' financial health.

Additionally, the dashboard classifies loans into Good and Bad categories for deeper KPI analysis:

✅ Good Loans: Percentage, count, funded amount, and received amount.

⚠️ Bad Loans: Percentage, count, funded amount, and received amount.

📈 Dashboard Components
1. Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line / Area Chart)

Displays seasonal patterns and overall lending trends over time.

2. Regional Analysis by State (Bar Chart)

Identifies states with significant lending activity and regional disparities.

3. Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart)

Shows the distribution of loans across various term lengths.

4. Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart)

Analyzes how loan metrics vary with borrower employment duration.

5. Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart)

Illustrates loan distribution by purpose to understand borrower intent.

6. Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map / Heat Map)

Highlights the relationship between home ownership and loan activity.

Each visualization tracks:

Total Loan Applications

Total Funded Amount

Total Amount Received

💡 Key Insights
Metric	Value	Insight
Total Loan Applications	38,576	Healthy application volume
Average Interest Rate	12.05%	Moderate lending cost
Average DTI Ratio	13.33%	Manageable borrower debt levels
Good Loan Ratio	86%	Strong repayment and credit quality
Bad Loan Ratio	13.8%	Indicates minor but notable risk
Total Funded Amount	$435.76M	Significant lending activity
Total Amount Received	$473.07M	Positive repayment trend
📊 Observations

The total amount received exceeds the total funded, indicating strong repayment behavior.

December 2021 saw the highest funded amount ($53.98M) — signaling peak lending activity.

86% of loans are in good standing, demonstrating solid credit performance.

Bad loans, though limited, exhibit repayment shortfall—an area for improved borrower screening.

🧠 Conclusion

Strong Lending Performance: High funding and repayment figures reflect profitable operations.

Healthy Portfolio: Majority of loans are performing well.

Moderate Risk: Small percentage of bad loans manageable with better risk assessment.

Growth Trend: Consistent increase in lending activity, especially toward year-end.
